# Voice Chat Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a complete voice chat system for your backend with WebSocket support. Here's what was added:

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Electron Client ←→ WebSocket ←→ Backend ←→ OpenAI APIs
                            (Python)      (STT/LLM/TTS)
```

## 📦 What Was Added

### 1. **Dependencies** (`pyproject.toml`)

- ✅ Added `websockets (>=13.1,<14.0.0)` for WebSocket support
- ✅ Already had `openai (>=1.59.8,<2.0.0)` installed

### 2. **Configuration** (`core/config.py`)

- ✅ Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable support
- Required for voice chat API access

### 3. **OpenAI Client** (`clients/openai_client.py`)

- ✅ `transcribe_audio()` - Uses `gpt-4o-transcribe` model
- ✅ `generate_response()` - Uses `gpt-5-mini` model
- ✅ `text_to_speech()` - Uses `gpt-4o-mini-tts` model
- ✅ `text_to_speech_stream()` - Streams audio for low latency

### 4. **Voice Chat Service** (`services/voice_chat_service.py`)

- ✅ Session management (create, clear, history)
- ✅ Audio to text transcription
- ✅ Text response generation with conversation history
- ✅ Text to speech conversion
- ✅ Complete voice message processing pipeline
- ✅ Streaming audio support

### 5. **Schemas** (`schemas/voice_chat.py`)

- ✅ All message types for WebSocket communication
- ✅ Type-safe Pydantic models for:
  - Session control (start, end)
  - Audio chunks (input/output)
  - Transcription
  - Response text
  - Audio streaming
  - Error handling

### 6. **WebSocket Route** (`api/routes/voice_chat.py`)

- ✅ WebSocket endpoint at `/api/v1/voice/ws`
- ✅ Connection management
- ✅ Message routing
- ✅ Session lifecycle handling
- ✅ Audio buffering and processing
- ✅ Real-time audio streaming to client
- ✅ Error handling

### 7. **API Integration** (`api/app.py`)

- ✅ Registered voice chat router
- ✅ Available at `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/ws`

### 8. **Documentation & Examples**

- ✅ `examples/voice_chat_client_example.js` - Complete Electron client example
- ✅ `examples/VOICE_CHAT_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 OpenAI Models Used

| Purpose                 | Model               | Endpoint                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Speech-to-Text**      | `gpt-4o-transcribe` | `v1/audio/transcriptions`         |
| **Response Generation** | `gpt-5-mini`        | `v1/responses` (Chat Completions) |
| **Text-to-Speech**      | `gpt-4o-mini-tts`   | `v1/audio/speech`                 |

## 🚀 How to Use

### Backend Setup

1. **Add to `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   **Voice Configuration**: Voice and system prompt are hardcoded in `clients/openai_client.py`:

   - `DEFAULT_TTS_VOICE = "alloy"`
   - `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a helpful gaming assistant..."`

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```

3. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. **WebSocket endpoint is now available at:**
   ```
   ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/ws
   ```

### Client (Electron) Integration

See `examples/voice_chat_client_example.js` for a complete working example.

**Quick example:**

```javascript
const client = new VoiceChatClient("ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/ws");

// Set up handlers
client.onTranscription = (text) => console.log("You said:", text);
client.onResponseText = (text) => console.log("AI says:", text);
client.onAudioChunk = (chunk) => playAudioChunk(chunk);

// Connect (system prompt and voice are configured on backend)
await client.connect();

// Start recording (captures mic and sends chunks)
startRecording();

// Stop recording (triggers processing)
stopRecording();
```

## 📨 Message Flow

1. Client sends `START_SESSION`
2. Server responds with `SESSION_STARTED`
3. Client streams `AUDIO_CHUNK` messages (while user talks)
4. Client sends `AUDIO_END` (user finished talking)
5. Server processes:
   - Transcribes audio → sends `TRANSCRIPTION`
   - Generates response → sends `RESPONSE_TEXT`
   - Converts to speech → sends `AUDIO_STREAM_START`
   - Streams audio → sends multiple `AUDIO_STREAM_CHUNK`
   - Finishes → sends `AUDIO_STREAM_END`
6. Client plays audio
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for conversation
8. Client sends `END_SESSION`
9. Server responds with `SESSION_ENDED`

## 🧪 Testing

### Test WebSocket Connection

Using Python:

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

async def test():
    uri = "ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/ws"
    async with websockets.connect(uri) as ws:
        # Start session
        await ws.send(json.dumps({
            "type": "start_session",
            "session_id": "test123"
        }))
        response = await ws.recv()
        print(response)

asyncio.run(test())
```

### Test with Postman/Insomnia

1. Create new WebSocket request
2. Connect to `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/ws`
3. Send JSON messages as per the protocol

## 🎤 Voice Configuration

TTS voice is hardcoded in `clients/openai_client.py`:

- `DEFAULT_TTS_VOICE = "alloy"` (options: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer)
- `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a helpful gaming assistant..."`

These are defined as constants in the methods, not fetched from environment variables.

**Security Note**: Clients cannot override these settings - they are controlled by the backend to ensure consistent behavior and prevent misuse.

## 📊 Audio Specifications

**Input (Client → Server):**

- Format: WAV
- Sample Rate: 16kHz recommended
- Channels: Mono (1)
- Encoding: Base64 in JSON

**Output (Server → Client):**

- Format: PCM (raw audio)
- Sample Rate: As per TTS model
- Channels: Mono (1)
- Encoding: Base64 in JSON

## 🔍 Next Steps

The voice chat is now fully functional! To get started:

1. ✅ Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
2. ✅ Run the backend with the command above
3. ✅ Use the example client code in your Electron app
4. ✅ Refer to `examples/VOICE_CHAT_README.md` for detailed usage

Later, you can add:

- Authentication (Auth0 token validation for WebSocket)
- Rate limiting
- Subscription tier checks
- Usage tracking
- Session persistence

## 💡 Tips

- The system maintains conversation history per session
- Audio is streamed for low latency
- Transcriptions and responses are sent before audio for better UX
- Sessions are automatically cleaned up when ended
- Error messages include codes for easy debugging

## 🐛 Debugging

Check logs for:

- WebSocket connection status
- Message types received
- Processing stages (transcription, generation, TTS)
- Errors with stack traces

Enable debug mode in `.env`:

```bash
DEBUG=True
```
